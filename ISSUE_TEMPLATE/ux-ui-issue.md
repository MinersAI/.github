Things to check before when creating an issue:
* Did you add a proper title?
  * Start with a verb e.g. _Fix_ or _Update_ (imperative mood)
  * Only a capital at the start of the title (except for brand names e.g. _GitHub_)
  * No punctuation
* Did you add it in the right project ([Development](https://github.com/orgs/MinersAI/projects/1))?
* Did you add the correct labels?
  * The correct type of issue?
  * The correct component label to indicate which part(s) of the platform the issue relates to?
